ADI DevFest Hackathon 2019 project

This program was created by Kate, Sofia, Karlo, and Ben (Team Delta) for ADI's DevFest Hackathon 2019. It won "Best Beginner Hack" overall. 

Magic is an interactive game designed to teach children how to code using an intuitive drag and drop interface accompanied by story-based graphics.

Aimed at the 6-10 year old demographic, it's visually based and approachable. The player is a "wizard" who drags spells (functions) from their spellbook (API) into the correct spots in order to solve problems and save a forest. Each coding challenge builds on the previous so that it is easy for kids to build basic intuition about how to solve problems with pseudo code. The story elements and increased visual cues makes it more approachable for our target demographic than traditional drag-and-drop coding languages.
